# Writing-Functions-in-Python
You'll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It's easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you're going to do any kind of analysis involving time, youâ€™ll want to use Python to sort it out. I have demonstrated how to work on counting different events using different datasets, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. I worked in both standard Python and in Pandas, and I'll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. The document can be consulted to handle date and time data in any format like a champion.
